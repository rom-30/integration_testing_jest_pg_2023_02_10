## Testing Principles

## Coverage
The output of the `jest --coverage` command displays a summary of the code coverage for the test suite run by Jest. The output is in the form of a table, with each row representing a file in the codebase and the corresponding coverage information for that file.

Here's an example of the output from `jest --coverage`:

```md
-----------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------------|
File             |  % Stmts | % Branch |  % Funcs |  % Lines |Uncovered Lines |
-----------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------------|
All files        |    87.5% |    82.4% |    85.7% |    87.5% |                |
 src/            |      100 |      100 |      100 |      100 |                |
  index.js       |      100 |      100 |      100 |      100 |                |
 src/components/ |    83.3% |       75 |       50 |    83.3% |                |
  Button.js      |    83.3% |       75 |       50 |    83.3% |             4,5|
-----------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------------|
```


## Statements
- The `% Stmts column` shows the percentage of statements that were executed by the test suite.
  - A statement is a single executable line of code, such as a variable assignment or a function call.


## Branch
- The `% Branch column` shows the percentage of branches that were executed by the test suite.
  - A branch is a point in the code where there is a decision that can be taken.
  There are a total of 2 branches in the code below.
    - tThe `if` branch and the `else` branch.
    - If both of these branches were executed during the test run, the "% Branch" for this code would be 100%. If only one branch was executed, the "% Branch" would be 50%.

```js
let age = 19;
if (age >= 18) {
  ...
} else {
  ...
}
```


## Functions
- the `% Funcs column` shows the percentage of functions that were executed by the test suite.
  - The percentage of functions covered is calculated as the number of functions executed divided by the total number of functions in a file.


## Lines
- the `% Lines column` shows the percentage of lines that were executed by the test suite.
  - The percentage of lines covered is calculated as the number of lines executed divided by the total number of lines in a file.
