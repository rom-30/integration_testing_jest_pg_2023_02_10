# What have we learnt
1. Tests cannot prove your code works; they can only prove it doesn't!
2. Having a high code coverage is a good indicator, but should not be the only indicator to rely on

## Testing Flow
1. setup
2. execution
3. verification

Also known as the **three A's**
1. Arrange
2. Act
3. Assert

## Red, Green, Refactor
Red, Green, Refactor is a common approach used in Test-Driven Development

* Red: write a failing test
* Green: write the minimum amount of code to make the test pass
* Refactor: improve the code
