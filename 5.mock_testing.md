## Mock testing
- Mocking is a technique used in software testing to isolate a unit of code being tested by replacing its dependencies with substitute objects. The main reason for mocking is to remove external dependencies and control the inputs to a system, making it easier to test and verify the behavior of the system under different conditions.

- For example, in an application that makes API calls to a server, it is often not feasible or practical to make actual API calls during testing. Mocking allows you to simulate the API calls and return pre-defined responses, so you can test the behavior of your code without having to wait for real responses from the API. This makes testing faster, more reliable, and less dependent on external factors such as network connectivity or API availability.

- Mocking also helps to isolate the code being tested and make tests more deterministic, as the behavior of the code is not dependent on external factors such as the state of a database or the behavior of other components in the system. This makes tests more repeatable and helps to ensure that tests are not affected by changes in other parts of the system.
