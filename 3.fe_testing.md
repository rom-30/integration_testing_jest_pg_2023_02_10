```rb
# spec/features/home_page_spec.rb
require 'rails_helper'

RSpec.feature "HomePage", type: :feature do
  scenario "User visits the home page" do
    visit root_path

    expect(page).to have_content("Welcome to the home page")
    click_on "Click here for more info"
    expect(page).to have_content("You have clicked the button")
  end
end
```
