## unit tests
- Unit testing is a software testing technique in which individual units or components of a software application are tested in isolation from the rest of the application.

- The goal of unit testing is to validate that each unit of the software application is working as intended and meets its specified requirements. Unit tests are usually automated and run every time the code is changed to make sure that new changes don't break the existing functionality.

## difference between manual an automated testing
- The main difference is the level of human involvement required.

- Manual testing requires a human tester to manually step through the test cases, while automated testing can be performed without human intervention.

- Automated testing is also more efficient and less error-prone than manual testing, making it ideal for large and complex software applications that need to be tested repeatedly.

- However, manual testing is still necessary in certain situations, such as exploratory testing and testing user interfaces that are difficult to automate.

## Integration testing
- Software testing technique that involves combining individual software components or systems and testing them as a group. The goal of integration testing is to verify that the interactions between components or systems work as expected and meet the specified requirements.

- By performing integration testing, software developers can ensure that the software works as intended and meets the specified requirements before it is released to end-users.

- Integration testing can be performed using a variety of techniques, including top-down integration, bottom-up integration, and big-bang integration.

- In top-down integration, the top-level components are tested first, followed by lower-level components.

- In bottom-up integration, the lower-level components are tested first and then combined to form higher-level components.

- In big-bang integration, all components are tested at once after they have been combined.
