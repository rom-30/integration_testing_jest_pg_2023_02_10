## jest.clearAllMocks() vs jest.resetAllMocks()

- **jest.clearAllMocks()** is used to clear the mock function's call history and any configuration information set on it.
  - This method is useful when you want to clear the state of the mock function between tests to avoid any potential interactions between test cases.

- **jest.resetAllMocks()** on the other hand, not only clears the call history and any configuration information, but also reverts the mock function back to its initial implementation.
  - This means that any modifications made to the mock function using **jest.spyOn**, **mockImplementation**, **mockImplementationOnce**, etc., will be undone and the mock function will behave as if it was just created. This method is useful for resetting the state of all mock functions between tests, so that each test starts with a clean slate.

- In summary, **jest.clearAllMocks()** is for clearing the mock function's state, while **jest.resetAllMocks()** is for resetting the mock function's implementation and state.
