- **--setupFiles** ./__tests__/integration/config.js:
  - specifies a configuration file that will be executed before running tests.

- **--watchAll**:
  - tells Jest to watch all files for changes and re-run the tests when a change is detected.

- **--detectOpenHandles**:
  - enables Jest to detect and report open handles, which are resources that are still in use after a test has completed.
  - if you're waiting for something to happen and it doesn't close it will let us know in a friendly way

    - https://jestjs.io/docs/cli#--runinband

- **--runInBand**:
  - run all tests serially in the current process, rather than creating a worker pool of child processes that run tests. This can be useful for debugging.

- **--verbose**:
  - makes Jest provide more detailed output, including individual test results, logs, and error messages.
